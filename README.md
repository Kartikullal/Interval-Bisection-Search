# Interval Bisection Search

In mathematics, the bisection method is a root-finding method that applies to any continuous functions for which one knows two values with opposite signs. The method consists of repeatedly bisecting the interval defined by these values and then selecting the subinterval in which the function changes sign, and therefore must contain a root. It is a very simple and robust method, but it is also relatively slow. Because of this, it is often used to obtain a rough approximation to a solution which is then used as a starting point for more rapidly converging methods.[1]

## Python Implementation of Interval Bisection Search

For this implementation, we have considered the convex function `f(x) = x^2`. You can change the convex functiont to whatever you like.

In this implementation, we have also counted the number of steps that will be needed to reach the minimum point.
